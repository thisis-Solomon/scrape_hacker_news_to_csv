Challenge: Hacker News Top Posts Scraper

Build a Python script that:
1. Fetches the HN homepage (news.ycombinator.com).
2. Extracts the top 20 posts titles and URLs.
3. Saves the results into a CSV file (hacker_news_top_posts.csv) with
columns: 
    - 'Title' 
    - 'URL'.
4. Handles potential errors gracefully (e.g., network issues, parsing errors).
